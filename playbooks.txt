Please generate a Playbook for malware attack? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : Malware Inncident Response Playbook
1. Preparation: : Determine the members of the Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT).
The core CSIRT members should be comprised of individuals responsible for cybersecurity only.
This may include some members of Information Technology roles, depending on the organization size.
The limited size of the core CSIRT is to assist with confidentiality and efficiency.
The core CSIRT may be activated often to investigate security events that may or may not result in an incident.
Assign roles and responsibilities to each member.
Determine extended CSIRT members.
This will often include Legal, Compliance, Public Relations, and Executive Leadership.
Define escalation paths.
Incidents may start as events, or as a lower impact/severity and then increase as more information is gathered. Establishing an escalation path is critical to success.
Evaluate and secure critical system backups.
Backups should be secured prior to any incident.
During the initial stages of any incident, evaluate and confirm that backups are secure and not impacted by the incident.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Isolate infected systems.
DO NOT power off machines, as forensic artifacts may be lost.
Preserve the system(s) for further forensic investigation including log review, MFT analysis, deep malware scans, etc.
Investigate malware to determine if it’s running under a user context.
If so, disable this account (or accounts if multiple are in use) until the investigation is complete.
Analyze the malware to determine characteristics that may be used to contain the outbreak.
If available, use a sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.
Note: Network connectivity should not be present for this sandbox system except in very rare circumstances. Network activity from malware may be used to alert an attacker of your investigation.
Observe any attempts at network connectivity, note these as Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
Observe any files created or modified by the malware, note these as IoCs.
Note where the malware was located on the infected system, note this as an IoC.
Preserve a copy of the malware file(s) in a password protected zip file.
Use the PowerShell “Get-FileHash” cmdlet to get the SHA-256 hash value of the malware file(s).
This hash may also be used to search for community information regarding this malware (i.e., VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, etc.).
Additional hash values (SHA1, MD5, etc.) may be gathered to better suit your security tools.
Note these hash values as IoCs.
Use all IoCs discovered to search any available tools in the environment to locate additional infected hosts.
Use all information and IoCs available to determine if the malware is associated with further attacks.
Examples: Emotet, Trickbot, and Qakbot are often involved in Ryuk ransomware attacks.
If further attacks are associated, gather all additional information available on these attacks to further the investigation.
Use all information and IoCs available to search for the initial point of entry.
Determine the first appearance of the malware.
Determine the user first impacted by the malware.
Investigate all available log files to determine the initial date and point of infection.
Analyze all possible vectors for infection.
Focus on known delivery methods discovered during malware analysis (email, PDF, website, packaged software, etc.).
3. Containment: : Use the information about the initial point of entry gathered in the previous phase to close any possible gaps.
Examples: Firewall configuration changes, email blocking rules, user education, etc.
Once the IoCs discovered in the Identification phase have been used to find any additional hosts that may be infected, isolate these devices as well.
Add IoCs (such as hash value) to endpoint protection.
Set to block and alert upon detection.
Submit hash value to community sources to aid in future detection.
NOTE: Clear this process with legal/compliance representatives during each incident, as each malware situation will be different.
If additional further attacks were noted as associated with the malware, use IoCs and threat-intel to apply additional controls to prevent the attack from escalating.
Implement any temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation required to contain the malware.
If additional accounts have been discovered to be involved or compromised, disable those accounts.
4. Eradication: : Preserve artifacts, systems, and relevant backups according to the sensitivity and scale of the incident.
These may be important for future forensics.
If rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives.
If rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.
Preserve any volatile data that may have been collected during the identification and containment phases (log files, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.).
Once all relevant data, equipment, and/or systems have been preserved, replace or rebuild systems accordingly.
5. Recovery: : Restore impacted systems from a clean backup, taken prior to infection if these backups are available.
For systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.
Remediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation.
Reset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.
Continue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period.
Alerts should be configured to aid in quick detection and response.
6. Lessons Learned: : Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss the following:
What things went well during the investigation?
What things did not go well during the investigation?
What vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization’s security status were identified?
How will these be remediated?
What further steps or actions would have been helpful in preventing the incident?
Review and update security measures:
Network segmentation
Firewall configuration
Application security
Operating System and/or Application patching procedures
Employee, IT, or CSIRT training
Create and distribute an incident report to relevant parties.
A primary, and more technical, report should be completed for the CSIRT.
An executive summary should be completed and presented to the management team.</s>

Please provide an incident response playbook for DDOS attack? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : DDOS attack Incident Response Playbook
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.
1.1 Internet Service Provider Support
Contact your ISP to understand the DDoS mitigation services it offers (free and paid) and what process you should follow.
If possible, subscribe to a redundant Internet connection and to an Anti-DDoS services provider.
Establish contacts with your ISP and law enforcement entities. Make sure that you have the possibility to use an out-of-band communication channel.
Make sure your ISP and DDoS mitigation service have a 24/7 phone support.
1.2 Inventory
Create a whitelist of the IP addresses and protocols you must allow if prioritizing traffic during an attack. Don’t forget to include your critical customers, key partners, etc.
Document your IT infrastructure details, including business owners, IP addresses and circuit IDs, routing settings; prepare a network topology diagram and an asset inventory.
1.3 Network Infrastructure
Design a good network infrastructure without Single Point of Failure or bottleneck.
Deploy a Web Application Firewall to protect against application-layer DDoS.
Distribute DNS servers and other critical services through different AS.
Harden the configuration of network, OS, and application components that may be targeted by DDoS.
Baseline your current infrastructure’s performance, so you can identify the attack faster and more accurately.
Confirm DNS time-to-live (TTL) settings for the systems that might be attacked. Lower the TTLs, if necessary, to facilitate DNS redirection if the original IP addresses get attacked. 600 is a good TTL value.
Depending on the criticality of services, consider setting up a backup that you can switch on in case of issue.
1.4 Internal Contacts
Establish contacts for your IDS, firewall, systems, and network teams.
Collaborate with the business lines to understand business implications of likely DDoS attack scenarios.
Involve your BCP/DR planning team on DDoS incidents.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.
2.1 Communication
Prepare an internal and an external communication template about DDoS incidents.
Identify channel where this communication will be posted.
The “preparation” phase is to be considered as the most important element of a successful DDoS incident response.
2.2 Analyze the Attack
Keep in mind the DDoS attack could be a smokescreen hiding a more sophisticated and targeted attack.
Check your anti-DDoS service analysis and your scrubbing centre reports:
Understand the logical flow of the DDoS attack and identify the infrastructure components affected by it.
Understand if you are the target of the attack or a collateral victim.
Review the load and log files of servers, routers, firewalls, applications, and other affected infrastructure.
Identify what aspects of the DDoS traffic differentiate it from benign traffic:
Source IP addresses, AS, etc.
Destination ports
URLs
Protocols flags
Network analysis tools can be used to review the traffic: Tcpdump, Tshark, Snort, Netflow, Ntop, MRTG, Cacti, Nagios
If possible, create a NIDS signature to differentiate between benign and malicious traffic.
2.3 Involve Internal and External Actors
Contact your internal teams to learn about their visibility into the attack.
Contact your ISP to ask for help. Be specific about the traffic you’d like to control:
Network blocks involved
Source IP addresses
Protocols
Notify your company’s executive and legal teams.
2.4 Check the Background
Find out whether the company received an extortion demand as a precursor to the attack:
Check for emails in your security email gateway based on a keyword list.
Some threat actors send extortion demands directly to the email addresses in the Whois records of the targeted website.
Look for revendications of the attack on Social Medias.
Search if anyone would have any interest in threatening your company:
Competitors
Ideologically-motivated groups (hacktivists)
Former employees
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.
3.1 Containment Actions
If the bottleneck is a particular feature of an application, temporarily disable that feature.
Attempt to throttle or block DDoS traffic as close to the network’s “cloud” as possible via a router, firewall, load balancer, specialized device, etc.
Terminate unwanted connections or processes on servers and routers and tune their TCP/IP settings.
If possible, switch to alternate sites or networks using DNS or another mechanism. Blackhole DDoS traffic targeting the original IP addresses.
Set up an alternate communication channel between you and your users/customers

1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.
1.1 Internet Service Provider Support
Contact your ISP to understand the DDoS mitigation services it offers.
If possible, subscribe to a redundant Internet connection and to an Anti-DDoS services provider.
Establish contacts with your ISP and law enforcement entities. Ensure you have an out-of-band communication channel.
Make sure your ISP and DDoS mitigation service have a 24/7 phone support.
1.2 Inventory
Create a whitelist of the IP addresses and protocols you must allow if prioritizing traffic during an attack. Include critical customers and key partners.
Document your IT infrastructure details, including business owners, IP addresses and circuit IDs, routing settings; prepare a network topology diagram and an asset inventory.
1.3 Network Infrastructure
Design a network infrastructure without Single Point of Failure or bottleneck.
Deploy DDoS protection services to handle high traffic volumes.
Distribute your DNS servers and other critical services through different AS.
Harden the configuration of network, OS, and application components that may be targeted by DDoS.
Baseline your current infrastructure’s performance, so you can identify the attack faster and more accurately.
If your business is Internet dependent, consider purchasing specialized DDoS mitigation products or services.
Confirm DNS time-to-live (TTL) settings for the systems that might be attacked. Lower the TTLs, if necessary, to facilitate DNS redirection if the original IP addresses get attacked. 
Depending on the criticality of your services, consider setting up a backup that you can switch on in case of an issue.
1.4 Internal Contacts
Establish contacts for your IDS, firewall, systems, and network teams.
Collaborate with the business lines to understand business implications of likely DDoS attack scenarios.
Involve your BCP/DR planning team in DDoS incidents.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.

2.2 Analyze the Attack
Keep in mind the DDoS attack could be a smokescreen hiding a more sophisticated and targeted attack.
Check your anti-DDoS service analysis and your scrubbing centre reports:
Understand the logical flow of the DDoS attack and identify the infrastructure components affected by it.
Understand if you are the target of the attack or a collateral victim.
Review the load and log files of servers, routers, firewalls, applications, and other affected infrastructure.
Identify what aspects of the DDoS traffic differentiate it from benign traffic:
Source IP addresses, AS, etc.
Destination ports
URLs
Protocols flags
Use network analysis tools to review the traffic
If possible, create a NIDS signature to differentiate between benign and malicious traffic.
2.3 Involve Internal and External Actors
Contact your internal teams to learn about their visibility into the attack.
Contact your ISP to ask for help. Be specific about the traffic you’d like to control:
Network blocks involved
Source IP addresses
Protocols
Notify your company’s executive and legal teams.

If possible, switch to alternate sites or networks using DNS or another mechanism. Blackhole DDoS traffic targeting the original IP addresses.
Set up an alternate communication channel between you and your users/customers 
If possible, route traffic through a traffic-scrubbing service or product via DNS or routing changes.
Configure egress filters to block the traffic your systems may send in response to DDoS traffic, to avoid adding unnecessary packets to the network.
In case of an extortion attempt, try to buy time with the fraudster. For example, explain that you need more time in order to get management approval.
3.2 ISP or Anti-DDoS Service Actions
If the bottleneck is at the ISP’s or anti-DDoS service’s side, only they can take efficient actions. In that case, work closely with your ISP and/or anti-DDoS provider and make sure you share information efficiently.

Determine initial method of account compromise. This will be limited to those with web application management/administrative access.
Interview impacted user to gather details on potential points of compromise.
Example questions:
Did you receive a suspicious email?
Did you enter your email credentials after clicking a link, or on a website that seemed to not accept them?
Have you downloaded any new software?
Have you received any documents via email that you weren’t expecting?
Have you noticed abnormal actions on your workstation?
Search for phishing emails.
Phishing emails are the most common method for credential theft.
Search for emails with links to credential harvesting sites.
Search the user’s web history to determine if any potentially malicious sites were visited.
Search for potential malware on the user’s workstation.
Credential harvesters such as Mimikatz.
Keystroke recording software.
Clipboard scraping malware.
Once the method of initial compromise is determined, use the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) gathered to search the environment for other victims.
Potential query inputs for email system: Email subject name, document name, document hash, URL from email, etc.
Potential query inputs for SIEM or log searches: IP addresses, URLs, workstation names, etc.
Review logs in account login systems searching for anomalies.
Login activity from unusual locations, systems, or browser fingerprints.
Note all systems accessed by the attacker if possible.
Assess victim accounts to determine if sensitive information may be contained in them or if they have access to sensitive information on centralized storage such as fileservers.
This may need to be extended to other sources these users and/or accounts have access to such as OneDrive, Google Drive, SharePoint, shared mailboxes, fileservers, etc.
If sensitive information is a possibility, consult legal counsel for next steps.
Use the information gathered to determine what sensitive information could’ve been accessed by the attacker.
If logs are unavailable, assume all accessible data was accessed by the attacker.
If account compromise has been ruled out, proceed to investigate potential web application vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
Perform a security scan.
Review vendor notifications of security issues.
Review community sourced threat intelligence related to the components in the web application.
3. Containment: : If management or administrative account compromise has been determined:
Reset all passwords associated with the management and administration of the web application.
Begin with the known compromised account passwords (if determined).
Enable Multi-Factor authentication anywhere possible for the impacted account(s).
Disable or reset alternative authentication methods such as certificates.
Revoke authentication tokens for all management/administrative account(s).
If an external organization is identified during the investigation, notify the organization of any compromises or concerns.
Work with legal counsel to determine this process.
This will help prevent the organization’s users from being targeted again from the same compromised source.
If malware is discovered during the investigation:
Preserve a sample of the malware.
Analyze the malware with any tools available.
Gather file hash using PowerShell “Get-Filehash” cmdlet.
Submit hash to community sources VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, etc.
If community sources have seen the hash, note the malware characteristics.
Isolate infected systems, do not power them off unless absolutely necessary.
Preserve the system(s) for further forensic investigation including log review, MFT analysis, deep malware scans, etc.
Block all associated IoCs in the email system, firewall, and other security components such as endpoint protection systems.
URLs, domains, message-ID, etc. in spam filters, email-based antimalware, etc.
File hashes, malware identified, IP addresses identified, etc.
Preserve a copy of any existing web application code that may be compromised and/or altered maliciously.
4. Eradication: : Compare current web application code to a known-good copy to determine if any malicious additions have been removed.
If systems were determined to be compromised with malware or by other means:
Preserve artifacts, systems, and relevant backups according to the sensitivity and scale of the incident. These may be important for future forensics.
If rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives.
If rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.
Preserve any volatile data that may have been collected during the identification and containment phases.
This may include log files, code samples, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.
Review and monitor logs to ensure that the compromise has been entirely contained.
5. Recovery: : Replace potentially compromised web application code with a known-good copy.
This may be completed by removing code anomalies or from restoring a known-good copy.
Review current web application code to ensure that all code anomalies have been removed.
This should be a new review, preferably by a different individual than the one who performed the review in Eradication step 1.
Restore web application functionality.
Restore impacted systems from a clean backup taken prior to infection if these backups are available.
For systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.
Remediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation.
Reset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.
Continue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period.
Alerts should be configured to aid in quick detection and response.
6. Lessons Learned: : Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss the following:
What things went well during the investigation?
What things did not go well during the investigation?
What vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization’s security status were identified?
How will these be remediated?
What further steps or actions would have been helpful in preventing the incident?
Review and update security measures:
Change control practices
Code review practices
Authentication practices
Multi-Factor Authentication
Password complexity and use
Privileged account access
Network segmentation
Firewall configuration
Application security
Operating System and/or Application patching procedures

<</SYS>>

Please generate a Playbook for compromised credentials? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : Compromised Credentials Incident Response Playbook
1. Preparation: : Determine the members of the Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT).
The core CSIRT members should be comprised of individuals responsible for cybersecurity only.
This may include some members of Information Technology roles, depending on the organization size.
The limited size of the core CSIRT is to assist with confidentiality and efficiency.
The core CSIRT may be activated often to investigate security events that may or may not result in an incident.
Assign roles and responsibilities to each member.
Determine extended CSIRT members.
This will often include Legal, Compliance, Public Relations, and Executive Leadership.
Define escalation paths.
Incidents may start as events, or as a lower impact/severity and then increase as more information is gathered. Establishing an escalation path is critical to success.
Ensure logging levels for account login system components (i.e. Active Directory, VPN, Remote Access, etc.) are set to appropriate levels.
90 days should be the minimum.
Ensure logging for account login system components are stored in secure locations, preferably on a secondary system such as a SIEM.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Use the evidence that resulted in notification of compromise to determine next steps based on the method of compromise.
Example of evidence: an email from an external client saying they received a phishing email or malware, abnormal login behavior or locations, actions performed by a user account that can’t be accounted for by the user, etc.
Method of compromise examples: credential harvesting phishing, credential scraping from local systems, brute forced password, etc.
Determine the initial method of account compromise.
Interview the impacted user to gather details on potential points of compromise.
Example questions:
Did you receive a suspicious email?
Did you enter the email credentials after clicking a link, or on a website that seemed to not accept them?
Have you downloaded any new software?
Have you received any documents via email that you weren’t expecting?
Have you noticed abnormal actions on your workstation?
Search for phishing emails.
Phishing emails are the most common method for credential theft.
Search for emails with links to credential harvesting sites.
Search the user’s web history to determine if any potentially malicious sites were visited.
Search for potential malware on the user’s workstation.
Credential harvesters such as Mimikatz.
Keystroke recording software.
Clipboard scraping malware.
Once the method of initial compromise is determined, use the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) gathered to search the environment for other victims.
Potential query inputs for the email system: Email subject name, document name, document hash, URL from email, etc.
Potential query inputs for SIEM or log searches: IP addresses, URLs, workstation names, etc.
Review logs in account login systems searching for anomalies.
Login activity from unusual locations, systems, or browser fingerprints.
Note all systems accessed by the attacker if possible.
Assess victim accounts to determine if sensitive information may be contained in them, or if they have access to sensitive information on centralized storage such as fileservers.
This may need to be extended to other sources these users and/or accounts have access to such as OneDrive, Google Drive, SharePoint, shared mailboxes, fileservers, etc.
If sensitive information is a possibility, consult legal counsel for next steps.
Use the information gathered to determine what sensitive information could’ve been accessed by the attacker.
If logs are unavailable, assume all accessible data was accessed by the attacker.
3. Containment: : Reset all passwords associated with all identified victims.
Begin with the known compromised account passwords, but all accounts associated with the user should have their passwords reset or disabled.
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) anywhere possible for the impacted user account.
Disable the user account’s ability to log in remotely.
Revoke authentication tokens for all identified victim accounts.
This should cover the email system and any other accounts that are associated with the impacted users.
If an external organization is identified during the investigation, notify the organization of any compromises or concerns.
Work with legal counsel to determine this process.
This will help prevent the organization’s users from being targeted again from the same compromised source.
If an external organization is identified during the investigation, block their related domains from sending email to the organization.
If malware is discovered during the investigation:
Preserve a sample of the malware.
Analyze the malware with any tools available.
Gather the file hash using the PowerShell “Get-Filehash” cmdlet.
Submit the hash to community sources VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, etc.
If community sources have seen the hash, note the malware characteristics.
Isolate infected systems, do not power them off unless absolutely necessary.
Preserve the system(s) for further forensic investigation including log review, MFT analysis, deep malware scans, etc.
Block all associated IoCs in the email system, firewall, and other security components such as endpoint protection systems (URLs, domains, message-ID, etc. in spam filters, email-based antimalware, etc., file hashes, malware identified, IP addresses identified, etc.).
4. Eradication: : Preserve artifacts, systems, and relevant backups according to the sensitivity and scale of the incident.
These may be important for future forensics.
If rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives.
If rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.
Preserve any volatile data that may have been collected during the identification and containment phases (log files, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.).
Once all relevant data, equipment, and/or systems have been preserved, replace or rebuild systems accordingly.
5. Recovery: : Restore impacted systems from a clean backup, taken prior to infection if these backups are available.
For systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.
Remediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation.
Reset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.
Continue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period.
Alerts should be configured to aid in quick detection and response.
6. Lessons Learned: : Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss the following:
What things went well during the investigation?
What things did not go well during the investigation?
What vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization’s security status were identified?
How will these be remediated?
What further steps or actions would have been helpful in preventing the incident?
Review and update security measures:
Authentication practices
Multi-Factor Authentication
Password complexity and use
Network segmentation
Firewall configuration
Application security
Operating System and/or Application patching procedures
Employee, IT, or CSIRT training
Create and distribute an incident report to relevant parties.

Please provide handling guidelines or incident response playbook for social engineering incident by phone or e-mail? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : Incident Response Playbook for social engineering incident by phone or e-mail
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.
Raise user awareness and security policies.
Never give any personal or corporate information to an unidentified person. This could include user IDs, passwords, account information, name, e-mail address, phone (mobile or landline) numbers, address, social security number, job titles, information on clients, organization orIT systems. The goal of the social engineer is to steal human resources, corporate secrets or customer/user data. 
Report any suspicious event to your manager, who will forward it to the CISO in orderto have a centralized reporting. 
Have a defined process to redirect any “weird” request to a “red” phone, if needed. 
Prepare to handle conversation with social engineers to identify which information could help tracking the attacker and his goals. 
Check your legal department to see which actions are allowed and which reactions they can handle.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.
Phone call / someone you don't know calls you/your service, asking for detailed information. 
If the contact works out of the company and requests for information that could be valuable for a competitor, deny his requests and go to part 3.
If the contact pretends to be an employee of your company but the phone number is hidden or not internal, propose that you call back to the declared number in the directory. If the supposedly attacker agrees, call back to check. If he rejects this option, go to part 3.
The attacker might use several techniques to entice his victim to speak (fear, curiosity, empathy ...). Do not disclose information in any case. Listen carefully to his requests and at the end ask for a phone number to call back or an email address to reply. Take notes and stay calm, even if the attacker is shouting or threatening, remember he tries to use human weaknesses.

If you can go further, the following information will be precious: 
the name of the correspondent 
requested information / people 
accent, language skills 
industry language and organizational knowledge 
background noises 
time and duration of the call 
E-mail / Someone you don't know requests detailed information: 
If the contact has an “out of the company” e-mail address and requests information that could be valuable for a competitor, go to part 3. 
If the contact uses an internal e-mail address but is asking for weird information, ask him some explanations and use the company directory to get his manager's name that you'll place as a copy.
Eventually notify top management to inform them that an incident has been encountered relating to a social engineering attack. They might understand the goals depending on the context.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.
At this step, you should be pretty sure that you're dealing with a social engineering attack. 

Actions for all employees: 
Phone call 
If the attacker urges you to give a phone number, follow these steps: 
Use the “red phone line” from your CERT/CSIRT, if existing. 
Give him the number with an invented name. 
Immediately call your CERT/CSIRT team explaining what happened and the chosen invented name. 
If the attacker stresses you too much and does not let you time to find the Red Phone number, ask him to call you back later, pretending a meeting. If the attacker wants to reach someone, follow these points : 
Place on hold the attacker and call CERT/CSIRT team and explain what happened. 
Transfer the conversation of the attacker to CERT/CSIRT team (do not give him the number). 

E-mail 
Forward to your security team all email including headers (send as attached documents) for investigation purposes. It might help to track the attacker.
Actions for CERT or incidentresponse team: 
▪ Phone call Resume the conversation with the attacker and use one of these techniques: 
Impersonate the identity of the people whom the attacker is willing to speak 
Slow down and make last the conversation and entice the attacker to make mistake 
Explain him that social engineering attack is forbidden by law, punished by sanctions and that lawyer team will handle the issue if it continues 
If the trap phone number has been used, prepare to “burn it”, create another one and display it in the directory. 
▪ E-mail 
Collect as much information as possible on the email address 
Analyze the email headers and try to locate the source 
Search the e-mail address with Internet tools 
Geolocalize the user behind the email address
4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.
Some possible remediation actions can be tried: 
Alert the law enforcement and/or file a complaint 
Discuss the problem in circles of trust to know if the company is facing this issue alone 
Threaten the attacker with legal actions if he can be identified 
Report email addresses used by the attacker to the provider abuse teams
5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.
Notify the top management of the actions and the decisions taken on the social engineering case.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident’s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.
Inform your hierarchy and subsidiaries about the incident, this could help to avoid similar attacks later. 
Report 
An incident report should be written and made available to all the actors of the incident. 
The following themes should be described: 
Initial cause of the infection 
Actions and timelines of every important event 
What went right 
What went wrong 
Incident cost (direct and indirect losses) 
Indicators of compromise 

Capitalize 
Actions to improve the social engineering handling processes should be defined to capitalize on this experience, especially awareness.</s>

Please provide guidelines or incident response playbook for Worm Infections? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : NIST compliant Incident Response Framework Playbook for Worm Infections
1. Preparation
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.
Define actors, for each entity, who will be involved into the crisis cell. These actors should be documented in a contact list kept permanently up to date. 
Make sure that analysis tools are up, functional (EDR, Antivirus, IDS, logs analyzers), not compromised, and up-to-date. 
Make sure to have architecture map of your networks. 
Make sure that an up-to-date inventory of the assets is available. 
Perform a continuous security watch and inform the people in charge of security about the threat trends.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.
2.1 Detect the Infection:
Detect the infection Information coming from several sources should be gathered and analyzed: 
Antivirus logs 
IDS/IPS 
EDR 
Suspicious connection attempts on servers 
High number of locked accounts 
Suspicious network traffic 
Suspicious connection attempts in firewalls 
High increase of support calls 
High load or system freeze 
High volumes of e-mail sent
If one or several of these symptoms have been spotted, the actors defined in the “preparation” step will get in touch and if necessary, create a crisis cell.
2.2 Identify the infection 
Analyze symptoms to identify the malware, its propagation vectors and countermeasures. 
Leads can be found from: 
CERT’s bulletins 
External support contacts (antivirus companies, etc.) 
Security websites 
Threat intelligence capabilities and providers
Notify Chief Information Security Officer. Contact your national CERT and regulators if required.
Assess the perimeter of the infection Define the boundaries of the infection. If possible, identify the business impact of the infection.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.
The following actions should be performed and monitored by the crisis management cell: 
3.1 Disconnect the infected area from the Internet. 
Isolate the infected area. Disconnect it from any network. 
If business-critical traffic cannot be disconnected, allow it after ensuring that it cannot be an infection vector or find validated circumventions techniques. 
Neutralize the propagation vectors. A propagation vector can be anything from network traffic to software flaw. Relevant countermeasures have to be applied (patch, traffic blocking, disable devices, etc.). 
For example, the following tools/techniques can be used: 
EDR 
Patch deployment tools (WSUS) 
Windows GPO 
Firewall rules 
Operational procedures 

Repeat steps 2 to 4 on each sub-area of the infected area until the worm stops spreading. If possible, monitor the infection using analysis tools (antivirus console, server logs, support calls). 
The spreading of the malware must be monitored.
3.2 Mobile devices 
Make sure that no laptop, Smartphone or mobile storage can be used as a propagation vector by the malware. If possible, block all their connections. 
Ask end-users to follow directives precisely.
4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.
4.1 Identify 
Identify tools and remediation methods. 
The following resources should be considered: 
Antivirus signature database 
External support contacts 
Security websites 
Yara scan, Loki, DFIR-ORC, ThorLite 
EDR search 
Define a Disinfection Process. The process has to be validated by an external structure, i.e. CERT, SOC, Incident Response team. The most straight-forward way to get rid ofthe worm is to remaster the machine.
4.2 Test 
Test the disinfection process and make sure that it properly works without damaging any service. 
4.3 Deploy 
Deploy the disinfection tools. Several options can be used: 
EDR 
Windows WSUS and GPO 
Antivirus signature deployment 
Manual disinfection 
Vulnerability patching

Warning: some worm can block some of the remediation deployment methods. If so, a workaround must be found. Remediation progress should be monitored by the crisis cell.
5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.
Verify all previous steps have been done correctly and get a management approval before following next steps: 
Reopen the network traffic that was used as a propagation method by the malware 
Reconnect sub-areas together 
Reconnect the mobile laptops to the area 
Reconnect the area to your local network 
Reconnect the area to the Internet 

All these steps shall be made in a step-by-step manner and a technical monitoring shall be enforced by the crisis team.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident’s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.
6.1 Report 
A crisis report should be written and made available to all of the actors of the crisis management cell. 
The following themes should be described: 
Initial cause of the infection 
Actions and timelines of every important event 
What went right 
What went wrong

Please generate a Ransomware incident response playbook? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : Ransomware Incident Response Playbook
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.
1.1 A good knowledge of:
The usual operating systems security policies is needed.
The usual users’ profile policies is needed.
1.2 Architecture, VLAN segmentation and interconnections:
Have the capability to isolate entities, regions, partners, or the Internet.
1.3 Security Product Updates
Ensure that the endpoint and perimeter (email gateway, proxy caches) security products are up to date.
1.4 Deploy an EDR solution on endpoints and servers:
This tool became one of the cornerstones of the incident response in case of ransomware or in large-scale compromise, facilitating identification, containment, and remediation phases.
Launch EDR Search and AV scan with IOC explicit rules and get first indicators for remediation progress following.
Set the EDR policies in prevent mode.
1.5 IT Support Awareness
Since this threat is often detected by end-users, raise the IT support awareness regarding the ransomware threat.
1.6 Block IOCs
Block IOCs linked to ransomware activities gathered by Threat Intelligence.
1.7 Deploy and operate security solutions enabling detection and facilitating response:
Log gathering in a SIEM.
Have the capacity to run tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC (ANSSI).
1.8 Backups Preparation
Make sure to have exhaustive, recent, and reliable backups of local and network users’ data.
Follow the 3-2-1 backup rules:
At least three copies: three different copies in different places. By keeping them in different places, it reduces the risk of a single event destroying multiple copies.
In two different formats: this means that you must use at least two different methods to store the data. For example, DVD, Hard drive, Cloud services are different formats. But if you store two copies on two hard drives, you are just using one format.
With one of those copies offsite: Keeping one copy off-site ensures that even if whatever happens where the data is (fire, break-in, natural disaster) at least one copy is safe somewhere else. In this rule, cloud services make sense.
Try to use one backup format stored out of the network: even if lateral movement happens from the threat that harms the network with encryption, one copy will be out of reach.
1.9 Log Management
Have good log retention and verbosity.
1.10 Posture and Communication
Define a strict posture versus the attacker.
Prepare internal and external communication strategy.
1.11 Immediate Response
If a machine is identified with ransomware, unplug it from the network and keep it turned on for memory forensics investigation.

Several leads might hint that the system could be compromised by ransomware:
Monitoring of ransomware IOCs by a SOC.
Supervision of EDR alerts.
Odd professional emails (often masquerading as invoices) containing attachments are being received.
A ransom message explaining that the documents have been encrypted and asking for money is displayed on the user’s desktop.
People are complaining about their files not being available or corrupted on their computers or their network shares with unusual extensions (.abc, .xyz, .aaa, etc.).
Numerous files are being modified in a very short period of time on the network shares.
Publication of information on the ransomware operator websites or forums.
Lateral movement is usually done; check all connections to the AD and ShareFile server with privileged accounts at abnormal times.
Look for unusual network or web browsing activities; especially connections to Tor I2P IP, Tor gateways (tor2web, etc.), or Bitcoin payment websites.
Look for rare connections.
2.2 Scoping of the Incident
EDR or large-scale hunting tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC allow the scoping of the ransomware-infected machines.
The identification of the initial access and the pivot used by the attackers is the priority, as in large-scale malware compromise. This allows establishing the following phase actions.
2.3 Threat Actor Identification
The identification of the Threat Actor at the origin of the ransomware attack could help the following phases based on known TTPs.
Ransomware network compromise identification has many similarities with large-scale malware compromise. Most of the time, reaction decisions must be taken faster in ransomware cases. For more details about large-scale malware compromise, please refer to IRM-18.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.

Disable accounts compromised/created by attackers.
Disconnect all computers that have been detected as compromised from the network.
You could isolate with EDR and shut down the internet while keeping EDR connections up.
If you cannot isolate computers, disconnect or cancel the shared drives.
(NET USE x: \unc\path\ /DELETE).
Monitor ransomware threat actor websites and the Internet for any data leak publication related to the ransomware compromise.
4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.
4.1 Remove Threat
Remove the initial access used by the attacker.
Remove binaries used by the attacker to move laterally on the network.
Remove any accounts created by attackers.
Revert configuration changes.

Use automated website scanners to regularly check for vulnerabilities and defacement.
Implement defenses against common exploitation points such as SQL injections and XSS attacks.
Install programs specifically designed to detect website defacement incidents.
1.7 Minimize Attack Surface
Use as few plug-ins as necessary and remove any that are unused or outdated.
Ensure all software and plug-ins are regularly updated to the latest versions.
1.8 Close Monitoring and Mandate Access
Closely monitor access to administrative content to ensure only authorized individuals have access.
Only grant access to individuals who need it, reducing the chance of human error leading to cyber attacks.
Discuss the importance of keeping administrative access limited and confidential with employees.
Conduct regular cybersecurity awareness training to reinforce these practices.
1.9 Employee Training and Awareness
Conduct regular cybersecurity training for all employees.
Promote awareness of the importance of security and how to recognize potential threats.
2. Detection and Analysis: : 2.1 Immediately take the defaced server offline for further investigation
This is especially important if the defacement is insulting or triggering in any way. Remove this from the public eye as quickly as possible to avoid harm as well as to mitigate business impact.
The defacement message may also contain false information that could mislead users or put them at risk.
Taking the server offline will allow a deeper investigation of the defacement. This may be necessary as the hacker may have dove deeper into the organization accessing application servers, databases, etc.
2.2 Determine the system's source of vulnerability that was used by the attacker. Common exploits include:
SQL injection attacks
This kind of attack occurs when an attacker interferes with an application's queries to the database. Therefore, this can lead to unauthorized access to private or sensitive data.
Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks
This kind of attack exploits an application's referencing function to upload malware from a remote URL.
Webshells
Poor web application design
JavaScript hacks
PHP/ASP hacks
Other methods of detection include:
Checking the server logs
Look through the web page's access log and error log for any suspicious or unfamiliar activity
It is also a good idea to check the IDS or IPS firewall logs, if available
Checking files with static content
Scanning databases for malicious content
Checking links present in the page
2.3 Collect any clues as to who the hacker is or what organization they are working for. Consider the following questions:
What did the defacement portray? Did it include an obvious message?
Did the defacement seem harmless or intentional? Could the hacker be a kid messing around or a professional group working with a motive?
Does it seem like your organization was targeted? Who may want to target your organization?
What did the hacker hope to accomplish?
Consult here to learn more about the types of hackers that may have attacked your webpage.
2.4 Collect other important information from the page that has been defaced such as:
A screenshot of the defacement
The domain and IP address of the page
Details of the web server
Page's source code
Analyze this carefully to identify the problem and ensure that it is on a server belonging to the company
Name or any information on the attacker
2.5 There are also tools available to aid in both detection and log analysis. A few are listed below:
Weblog Expert
Sawmill
Deep Log Analyzer
3. Containment: : 3.1 Backup all data stored on the web server for forensic purposes.
3.2 As previously mentioned, make sure to take the defaced page's server down temporarily while the investigation occurs.
Have an error page prepared for this situation that informs user and/or employees that maintenance is underway and the page they sought will return shortly.
have a backup website prepared where you may publish content while investigation and remediation are underway and have your temporary error page redirect users to this backup site.
Check network architecture map. If the breach is another system on the network, take that down and investigate it.
3.3 Once the source of the attack has been determined, apply the necessary steps to ensure this will not happen again. This may include modifying code or editing access rights.
Reference the ""Investigate"" section for common sources of vulnerability.
If this is outside of your domain, simply ensure that you have given the appropriate personnel all the information on the attack that you have and allow experts to do their job.
4. Eradication: : 4.1 Remove the hacker's message and replace it with original, legitimate content. If data was lost in the attack, reference backups and restore the original page as much as possible.
Check backups for indicators of compromise
Consider partial recovery and backup integrity testing
4.2 Consider asking users to change their login credentials if the web server has user authentication.
5. Recovery: : 5.1 After implementing risk avoidance measures (as recommended below), restore your server showing the original page content.
5.2 If necessary and/or applicable, prepare an apology/explanation of the attack that occurred for users or anyone who witnessed the defacement. Ensure that it is clear that the defacement content does not reflect your organization in any way.
6. Lessons Learned: : 6.1 Post-Incident Review
Conduct a thorough post-incident review to understand the root cause of the defacement.
Identify what worked well and what could be improved in the response process.
6.2 Documentation and Reporting
Document all findings, actions taken, and outcomes of the incident.
Prepare a detailed report for stakeholders and leadership, highlighting lessons learned and areas for improvement.
6.3 Update Incident Response Plan
Revise the incident response plan based on lessons learned.
Incorporate new procedures, tools, and best practices identified during the incident response.
6.4 Share Knowledge
Share lessons learned with relevant teams and stakeholders to improve overall organizational security posture.
Conduct training sessions or workshops to disseminate findings and recommendations.
6.5 Continuous Improvement
Establish a process for continuous improvement of incident response capabilities.
Regularly review and update security policies, procedures, and technologies to stay ahead of emerging threats.</s>
