[/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.\nTitle: : Malware Inncident Response Playbook\n1. Preparation: : Determine the members of the Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT).\nThe core CSIRT members should be comprised of individuals responsible for cybersecurity only.\nThis may include some members of Information Technology roles, depending on the organization size.\nThe limited size of the core CSIRT is to assist with confidentiality and efficiency.\nThe core CSIRT may be activated often to investigate security events that may or may not result in an incident.\nAssign roles and responsibilities to each member.\nDetermine extended CSIRT members.\nThis will often include Legal, Compliance, Public Relations, and Executive Leadership.\nDefine escalation paths.\nIncidents may start as events, or as a lower impact/severity and then increase as more information is gathered. Establishing an escalation path is critical to success.\nEvaluate and secure critical system backups.\nBackups should be secured prior to any incident.\nDuring the initial stages of any incident, evaluate and confirm that backups are secure and not impacted by the incident.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Isolate infected systems.\nDO NOT power off machines, as forensic artifacts may be lost.\nPreserve the system(s) for further forensic investigation including log review, MFT analysis, deep malware scans, etc.\nInvestigate malware to determine if it’s running under a user context.\nIf so, disable this account (or accounts if multiple are in use) until the investigation is complete.\nAnalyze the malware to determine characteristics that may be used to contain the outbreak.\nIf available, use a sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\nNote: Network connectivity should not be present for this sandbox system except in very rare circumstances. Network activity from malware may be used to alert an attacker of your investigation.\nObserve any attempts at network connectivity, note these as Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).\nObserve any files created or modified by the malware, note these as IoCs.\nNote where the malware was located on the infected system, note this as an IoC.\nPreserve a copy of the malware file(s) in a password protected zip file.\nUse the PowerShell “Get-FileHash” cmdlet to get the SHA-256 hash value of the malware file(s).\nThis hash may also be used to search for community information regarding this malware (i.e., VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, etc.).\nAdditional hash values (SHA1, MD5, etc.) may be gathered to better suit your security tools.\nNote these hash values as IoCs.\nUse all IoCs discovered to search any available tools in the environment to locate additional infected hosts.\nUse all information and IoCs available to determine if the malware is associated with further attacks.\nExamples: Emotet, Trickbot, and Qakbot are often involved in Ryuk ransomware attacks.\nIf further attacks are associated, gather all additional information available on these attacks to further the investigation.\nUse all information and IoCs available to search for the initial point of entry.\nDetermine the first appearance of the malware.\nDetermine the user first impacted by the malware.\nInvestigate all available log files to determine the initial date and point of infection.\nAnalyze all possible vectors for infection.\nFocus on known delivery methods discovered during malware analysis (email, PDF, website, packaged software, etc.).\n3. Containment: : Use the information about the initial point of entry gathered in the previous phase to close any possible gaps.\nExamples: Firewall configuration changes, email blocking rules, user education, etc.\nOnce the IoCs discovered in the Identification phase have been used to find any additional hosts that may be infected, isolate these devices as well.\nAdd IoCs (such as hash value) to endpoint protection.\nSet to block and alert upon detection.\nSubmit hash value to community sources to aid in future detection.\nNOTE: Clear this process with legal/compliance representatives during each incident, as each malware situation will be different.\nIf additional further attacks were noted as associated with the malware, use IoCs and threat-intel to apply additional controls to prevent the attack from escalating.\nImplement any temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation required to contain the malware.\nIf additional accounts have been discovered to be involved or compromised, disable those accounts.\n4. Eradication: : Preserve artifacts, systems, and relevant backups according to the sensitivity and scale of the incident.\nThese may be important for future forensics.\nIf rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives.\nIf rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.\nPreserve any volatile data that may have been collected during the identification and containment phases (log files, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.).\nOnce all relevant data, equipment, and/or systems have been preserved, replace or rebuild systems accordingly.\n5. Recovery: : Restore impacted systems from a clean backup, taken prior to infection if these backups are available.\nFor systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.\nRemediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation.\nReset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.\nContinue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period.\nAlerts should be configured to aid in quick detection and response.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss the following:\nWhat things went well during the investigation?\nWhat things did not go well during the investigation?\nWhat vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization’s security status were identified?\nHow will these be remediated?\nWhat further steps or actions would have been helpful in preventing the incident?\nReview and update security measures:\nNetwork segmentation\nFirewall configuration\nApplication security\nOperating System and/or Application patching procedures\nEmployee, IT, or CSIRT training\nCreate and distribute an incident report to relevant parties.\nA primary, and more technical, report should be completed for the CSIRT.\nAn executive summary should be completed and presented to the management team.</s>\n\n"},

Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.\n3.1 Containment Actions\nIf the bottleneck is a particular feature of an application, temporarily disable that feature.\nAttempt to throttle or block DDoS traffic as close to the network’s “cloud” as possible via a router, firewall, load balancer, specialized device, etc.\nTerminate unwanted connections or processes on servers and routers and tune their TCP/IP settings.\nIf possible, switch to alternate sites or networks using DNS or another mechanism. Blackhole DDoS traffic targeting the original IP addresses.\nSet up an alternate communication channel between you and your users/customers \nIf possible, route traffic through a traffic-scrubbing service or product via DNS or routing changes \nConfigure egress filters to block the traffic your systems may send in response to DDoS traffic to avoid adding unnecessary packets to the network.\nIn case of an extortion attempt, try to buy time with the fraudster. For example, explain that you need more time in order to get management approval.\n3.2 ISP or Anti-DDoS Service Actions\nIf the bottleneck is at the ISP’s or anti-DDoS service’s side, only they can take efficient actions. In that case, work closely with your ISP and/or anti-DDoS provider and make sure you share information efficiently.\n4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.\n4.1 Remediation Measures\nContact your ISP and/or anti-DDoS provider and make sure that they enforce remediation measures. Possible measures include:\nFiltering \nTraffic-scrubbing/Sinkhole/Clean-pipe\nIP public balancing/splitting/switching\nBlackhole Routing\nTechnical remediation actions can mostly be enforced by your ISP and/or anti-DDoS provider.\nIf the attack had a major impact, you may have to make an incident report to regulators.\n5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.\n5.1 Assess the End of the DDoS Condition\nEnsure that the impacted services are reachable again.\nEnsure that your infrastructure performance is back to your baseline performance.\n5.2 Rollback the Mitigation Measures\nSwitch back traffic to your original network.\nRestart stopped services.\nEnsure that the recovery-related actions are decided in accordance with the network teams.

Network activity from malware may be used to alert an attacker of your investigation.\nObserve any attempts at network connectivity, note these as Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).\nObserve any files created or modified by the malware, note these as IoCs.\nNote where the malware was located on the infected system, note this as an IoC.\nPreserve a copy of the malware file(s) in a password protected zip file.\nUse the PowerShell “Get-FileHash” cmdlet to get the SHA-256 hash value of the malware file(s).\nThis hash may also be used to search for community information regarding this malware (i.e., VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, etc.)\nAdditional hash values (SHA1, MD5, etc.) may be gathered to better suit your security tools.\nNote these hash values as IoCs.\nUse all IoCs discovered to search any available tools in the environment to locate additional infected hosts.\nUse all information and IoCs available to search for the initial point of entry.\nDetermine the first appearance of the malware.\nDetermine the user first impacted by the malware.\nInvestigate all available log files to determine the initial date and point of infection.\nAnalyze all possible vectors for infection.\nFocus on known delivery methods discovered during malware analysis (email, PDF, website, packaged software, etc.).\nOnce the ransomware variant is identified, perform research to determine Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) associated with this variant and/or threat-actor.\nDetermine if data exfiltration and extortion is common.\nDetermine the attacker toolkit if possible.\n3. Containment: : Use the information about the initial point of entry gathered in the previous phase to close any possible gaps.\nExamples: Firewall configuration changes, email blocking rules, user education, etc.\nOnce the IoCs discovered in the Identification phase have been used to find any additional hosts that may be infected, isolate these devices as well.\nAdd IoCs (such as hash value) to endpoint protection.\nSet to block and alert upon detection.\nSubmit hash value to community sources to aid in future detection.\nNOTE: Clear this process with legal/compliance representatives during each incident, as each malware situation will be different.\nImplement any temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation required to contain the malware.\nIf additional accounts have been discovered to be involved or compromised, disable those accounts.\n4. Eradication: : Preserve artifacts, systems, and relevant backups according to the sensitivity and scale of the incident. These may be important for future forensics.\nIf rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives.\nIf rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.\nPreserve any volatile data that may have been collected during the identification and containment phases.\nThis may include log files, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.\nOnce all relevant data, equipment, and/or systems have been preserved, replace or rebuild systems accordingly.\n5. Recovery: : Restore impacted systems from a clean backup, taken prior to infection if these backups are available.\nFor systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.\nRemediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation.\nReset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.\nContinue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period.\nAlerts should be configured to aid in quick detection and response.\nIf data exfiltration and extortion were determined to be part of this attack, work with legal counsel to determine next steps.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss the following:\nWhat things went well during the investigation?\nWhat things did not go well during the investigation?\nWhat vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization’s security status were identified?\nHow will these be remediated?\nWhat further steps or actions would have been helpful in preventing the incident?\nReview and update security measures:\nNetwork segmentation\nFirewall configuration\nApplication security\nOperating System and/or Application patching procedures\nEmployee, IT, or CSIRT training\nCreate and distribute an incident report to relevant parties.\nA primary, and more technical, report should be completed for the CSIRT.\nAn executive summary should be completed and presented to the management team.</s>\n\n"},

Detection and Analysis: : Isolate Infected Systems:\nIsolation Procedures: Isolate infected systems immediately to prevent the spread of malware. DO NOT power off machines, as forensic artifacts may be lost.\nPreservation: Preserve the system(s) for further forensic investigation, including log review, MFT analysis, deep malware scans, etc.\nInvestigate Malware Context:\nUser Context Investigation: Determine if the malware is running under a user context. If so, disable this account (or accounts if multiple are in use) until the investigation is complete.\nMalware Analysis:\nCharacteristics Analysis: Analyze the malware to determine characteristics that may be used to contain the outbreak. Use a sandboxed malware analysis system to perform this analysis.\nIoCs Collection: Observe any network connectivity attempts, files created or modified by the malware, and note the location of the malware on the infected system. Preserve a copy of the malware file(s) in a password-protected zip file. Use PowerShell “Get-FileHash” cmdlet to get the SHA-256 hash value of the malware file(s) and gather additional hash values (SHA1, MD5, etc.).\nNetwork Connectivity: Note that network activity from malware may alert an attacker of your investigation; thus, network connectivity should not be present for this sandbox system except in very rare circumstances.\nUtilize IoCs:\nSearch Tools: Use all IoCs discovered to search any available tools in the environment to locate additional infected hosts.\nAssociated Attacks: Determine if the malware is associated with further attacks (e.g., Emotet, Trickbot, and Qakbot often involved in Ryuk ransomware attacks).\nInitial Point of Entry:\nIdentify Entry Point: Use all information and IoCs available to search for the initial point of entry.

[/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.\nTitle: : Ransomware Incident Response Playbook\n1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.\n1.1 A good knowledge of:\nThe usual operating systems security policies is needed.\nThe usual users’ profile policies is needed.\n1.2 Architecture, VLAN segmentation and interconnections:\nHave the capability to isolate entities, regions, partners, or the Internet.\n1.3 Security Product Updates\nEnsure that the endpoint and perimeter (email gateway, proxy caches) security products are up to date.\n1.4 Deploy an EDR solution on endpoints and servers:\nThis tool became one of the cornerstones of the incident response in case of ransomware or in large-scale compromise, facilitating identification, containment, and remediation phases.\nLaunch EDR Search and AV scan with IOC explicit rules and get first indicators for remediation progress following.\nSet the EDR policies in prevent mode.\n1.5 IT Support Awareness\nSince this threat is often detected by end-users, raise the IT support awareness regarding the ransomware threat.\n1.6 Block IOCs\nBlock IOCs linked to ransomware activities gathered by Threat Intelligence.\n1.7 Deploy and operate security solutions enabling detection and facilitating response:\nLog gathering in a SIEM.\nHave the capacity to run tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC (ANSSI).\n1.8 Backups Preparation\nMake sure to have exhaustive, recent, and reliable backups of local and network users’ data.\nFollow the 3-2-1 backup rules:\nAt least three copies: three different copies in different places. By keeping them in different places, it reduces the risk of a single event destroying multiple copies.\nIn two different formats: this means that you must use at least two different methods to store the data. For example, DVD, Hard drive, Cloud services are different formats. But if you store two copies on two hard drives, you are just using one format.\nWith one of those copies offsite: Keeping one copy off-site ensures that even if whatever happens where the data is (fire, break-in, natural disaster) at least one copy is safe somewhere else. In this rule, cloud services make sense.\nTry to use one backup format stored out of the network: even if lateral movement happens from the threat that harms the network with encryption, one copy will be out of reach.\n1.9 Log Management\nHave good log retention and verbosity.\n1.10 Posture and Communication\nDefine a strict posture versus the attacker.\nPrepare internal and external communication strategy.\n1.11 Immediate Response\nIf a machine is identified with ransomware, unplug it from the network and keep it turned on for memory forensics investigation.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.\n2.1 General Signs of Ransomware Presence\nSeveral leads might hint that the system could be compromised by ransomware:\nMonitoring of ransomware IOCs by a SOC.\nSupervision of EDR alerts.\nOdd professional emails (often masquerading as invoices) containing attachments are being received.\nA ransom message explaining that the documents have been encrypted and asking for money is displayed on the user’s desktop.\nPeople are complaining about their files not being available or corrupted on their computers or their network shares with unusual extensions (.abc, .xyz, .aaa, etc.).\nNumerous files are being modified in a very short period of time on the network shares.\nPublication of information on the ransomware operator websites or forums.\nLateral movement is usually done; check all connections to the AD and ShareFile server with privileged accounts at abnormal times.\nLook for unusual network or web browsing activities; especially connections to Tor I2P IP, Tor gateways (tor2web, etc.), or Bitcoin payment websites.\nLook for rare connections.\n2.2 Scoping of the Incident\nEDR or large-scale hunting tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC allow the scoping of the ransomware-infected machines.\nThe identification of the initial access and the pivot used by the attackers is the priority, as in large-scale malware compromise. This allows establishing the following phase actions.\n2.3 Threat Actor Identification\nThe identification of the Threat Actor at the origin of the ransomware attack could help the following phases based on known TTPs.\nRansomware network compromise identification has many similarities with large-scale malware compromise. Most of the time, reaction decisions must be taken faster in ransomware cases. For more details about large-scale malware compromise, please refer to IRM-18.\n3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.\n3.1 Public Statement\nMake a public statement as soon as possible based on the communication template elaborated in the preparation phase.\n3.2 Follow Defined Posture\nFollow the posture defined in the preparation phase.\n3.3 Security Provider Actions\nSend the undetected samples to the endpoint security provider and/or private sandboxes.\nSend the uncategorized malicious URLs, domain names, and IPs to the perimeter security provider.\nBlock traffic to C2s.\nBlock any IP detected as used by attackers.\n3.4 Isolation\nIsolate compromised VLANs, interconnections, entities, regions, partners, or the Internet.\nDisable accounts compromised/created by attackers.\nDisconnect all computers that have been detected as compromised from the network.\nYou could isolate with EDR and shut down the internet while keeping EDR connections up.\nIf you cannot isolate computers, disconnect or cancel the shared drives.\n(NET USE x: \\unc\\path\\ /DELETE).\nMonitor ransomware threat actor websites and the Internet for any data leak publication related to the ransomware compromise.\n4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.\n4.1 Remove Threat\nRemove the initial access used by the attacker.\nRemove binaries used by the attacker to move laterally on the network.\nRemove any accounts created by attackers.\nRevert configuration changes.\nOperate systems and network configuration hardening.\n5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.\n5.1 Antivirus and Malicious Binaries\nUpdate antivirus signatures for identified malicious binaries to be blocked.\nEnsure that no malicious binaries are present on the systems before reconnecting them.\nEnsure that the network traffic is back to normal.\n5.2 Document Restoration\nRestore user’s documents from backups.\nPrioritize the recovery plan based on the DRP (disaster recovery plan).\nAll of these steps shall be made in a step-by-step manner and with technical monitoring.\n5.3 Backup Verification and System Reimaging\nVerify that backups are not compromised: only restore from a backup if you are very confident that the backup and the device you are connecting it to are clean.\nOR reimage the computer with a clean install.\n5.4 Credential Reset\nReset credentials including passwords (especially for administrator and other system accounts).\n5.5 Network Monitoring\nMonitor network traffic to identify if any infection remains.\nIf possible, apply geo-filtering on firewalls to block illegitimate foreign country traffic.\nMaintain the monitoring ransomware threat actor websites and the Internet to find if there is any data leak publication related to the ransomware compromise.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident’s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.\n6.1 Report\nAn incident report should be written and made available to all the stakeholders. The following themes should be described:\nInitial cause of the infection.\nActions and timelines of every important event.\nWhat went right.\nWhat went wrong.\nIncident cost.\nIndicators of compromise.\n6.2 Capitalize\nActions to improve malware and network intrusion detection processes should be defined to capitalize on this experience.</s>\n\n"},
